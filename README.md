# Mirror

Digital mirror applies pixel sort to a live webcam feed. The circle in the center of the image shows the original colors of the webcam
as they are captured live, but sorts them by color for a new aesthetic. 

Outside the circle you can see the live feed in black and white. When items are held before the camera, you do not know what color the objects are until you see a strip of their original color run across the pixel sorted circle. 

A video demo of the project an be found [here](https://vimeo.com/255944222).
